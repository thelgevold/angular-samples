**** These samples are no longer maintained ****



These samples use Angular 9.0.0 and SvelteJS with backends in Node/Express and Go. Everything is built in the same Bazel build.

Here are the prerequisites for running the project:

1) npm i

2) npm start

This starts a bazel build with file watching (iBazel).

The application is hosted at http://localhost:3000
